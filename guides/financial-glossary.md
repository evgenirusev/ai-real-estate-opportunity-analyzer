> **Purpose:** Ensure consistent understanding of every metric used in the scoring system.

## Core Income Metrics

### NOI (Net Operating Income)

```
NOI = Effective Gross Income − Total Operating Expenses
```

- Excludes debt service and capital expenditures
- The fundamental measure of property-level profitability

---

### Effective Gross Income (EGI)

```
EGI = Gross Potential Rent − Vacancy Loss + Other Income
```

- Accounts for realistic vacancy expectations
- Includes ancillary income (parking, storage, etc.)

---

## Yield & Return Metrics

### CAP RATE (Capitalization Rate)

```
Cap Rate = (NOI ÷ Total Acquisition Cost) × 100
```

- **Interpretation:** Unlevered return on the asset itself
- Higher cap rate = higher yield but potentially higher risk

---

### GROSS RENTAL YIELD

```
Gross Yield = (Annual Gross Rental Income ÷ Purchase Price) × 100
```

- Quick comparison metric
- Does not account for expenses

---

### NET RENTAL YIELD

```
Net Yield = (NOI ÷ Purchase Price) × 100
```

- More accurate than gross yield
- Accounts for operating expenses

---

### CASH-ON-CASH RETURN (CoC)

```
CoC = (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow ÷ Total Cash Invested) × 100
```

Where:
- Total Cash Invested = Down payment + Closing costs + Renovation
- Cash Flow = NOI − Annual Debt Service

> **Note:** For all-cash purchases, CoC ≈ Net Yield

---

### ROI (Return on Investment)

```
ROI = (Total Gain from Investment ÷ Total Cost of Investment) × 100
```

Where:
- Total Gain = Cumulative Cash Flow + Appreciation − Selling Costs

---

### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)

```
IRR = Discount rate that makes NPV of all cash flows = 0
```

- Accounts for time value of money
- **Best single metric** for comparing investments of different sizes and durations

---

## Risk & Coverage Metrics

### PAYBACK PERIOD

```
Payback Period = Total Investment ÷ Annual Net Cash Flow
```

- Years to recoup initial investment from income alone

---

### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)

```
DSCR = NOI ÷ Annual Debt Service
```

- Minimum healthy level: **1.25**
- Lender threshold typically: **1.20**

---

### BREAK-EVEN OCCUPANCY

```
Break-Even Occupancy = (Total Operating Expenses ÷ Gross Potential Rent) × 100
```

- The occupancy rate at which income covers all expenses
- Lower is better (more margin for error)

---

## Value Metrics

### EQUITY MULTIPLE

```
Equity Multiple = Total Distributions ÷ Total Equity Invested
```

- A 2.0x equity multiple = you doubled your money
- Includes both cash flow and exit proceeds

---

### FORCED EQUITY / VALUE-ADD GAIN

```
Forced Equity = Post-Renovation Market Value − (Purchase Price + Renovation Cost)
```

- Measures wealth created through improvements
- Key metric for value-add strategies

---

## Market Comparison Metrics

### PRICE-TO-RENT RATIO

```
Price-to-Rent = Property Price ÷ Annual Rent
```

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| < 15 | Favors buying |
| 15-20 | Neutral |
| > 20 | Favors renting |

For investors: **Lower ratio = Better rental yield**

---

### PRICE-TO-INCOME RATIO

```
Price-to-Income = Median Property Price ÷ Median Annual Household Income
```

- Measures affordability
- **Higher = Less affordable market**

---

### GRM (Gross Rent Multiplier)

```
GRM = Property Price ÷ Gross Annual Rent
```

- Quick screening metric
- **Lower = Better value**

---

## Quick Reference Table

| Metric | Formula | Good Threshold |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Net Yield | NOI ÷ Price × 100 | ≥ 4.5% |
| Cap Rate | NOI ÷ Acquisition Cost × 100 | ≥ 5% |
| Cash-on-Cash | Cash Flow ÷ Cash Invested × 100 | ≥ 6% |
| DSCR | NOI ÷ Debt Service | ≥ 1.25 |
| Payback Period | Investment ÷ Annual Cash Flow | ≤ 15 years |
| Break-Even Occupancy | Expenses ÷ Gross Rent × 100 | ≤ 55% |
